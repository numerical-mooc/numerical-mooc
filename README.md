#Practical Numerical Methods in Python

A multi-campus, connected course (plus MOOC) on numerical methods for differential equations in science and engineering. Collaboratively developed by:
- Lorena A. Barba, George Washington University, USA
- Ian Hawke, Soutahmpton University, UK
- Carlos Jerez, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile
- David Ketcheson, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia

Unfortunately, David's course was cancelled and he had to bail out of the MOOC.

##List of Modules

1. **The phugoid model of glider flight.**
Described by a set of two nonlinear ordinary differential equations, the phugoid model motivates numerical time integration methods, and we build it up starting from one simple equation, so that the unit can include 4 or 5 lessons  on initial-value problems. Roughly, this module would include: a) Forward/backward differencing and Euler's method for one equation; b) extend to multiple equations and the full phugoid model; c) modified Euler / Euler predictor-corrector / some other simple 2nd-order method, convergence testing, local vs. global error; d) Runge-Kutta methods; e) stiff systems, adaptive stepping and/or multistep methods.
Computational techniques: array operations with NumPy; symbolic computing with SymPy; ODE integrators and libraries; writing and using functions.
2. **Space and Time—Introduction to finite-difference solutions of PDEs.**
Starting with the simplest model represented by a partial differential equation (PDE)—the linear convection equation in one dimension—, this module builds the foundation of using finite differencing in PDEs. (The module is based on the “CFD Python” collection, steps 1 through 4.)  It also motivates CFL condition, numerical diffusion, accuracy of finite-difference approximations via Taylor series, consistency and stability, and the physical idea of conservation laws.
Computational techniques: more array operations with NumPy and symbolic computing with SymPy; getting high performance with Numba.
3. **Riding the wave: convection problems.**
Starting with the inviscid Burgers’ equation in conservation form and a 1D shock wave, cover a sampling of finite-difference convection schemes of various types: upwind, Lax-Friedrichs, Lax-Wendroff, MacCormack, then MUSCL (discussing limiters). Traffic-flow equation with MUSCL (from HyperPython). Reinforce concepts of numerical diffusion and stability, in the context of solutions with shocks.  It will motivate spectral analysis of schemes, dispersion errors, Gibbs phenomenon, conservative schemes.
4. **Spreading out: Parabolic PDEs.**
Start with heat equation in 2D (first introduction of two-dimensional FD discretization). Introduce implicit methods: backward Euler, trapezoidal rule (Crank-Nicolson), backward-differentiation formula (BDF). Pattern formation models (reaction-diffusion). Theory content: A-stability (unconditional stability), L-stability (?). Fourier spectral methods and splitting.
5. **Relax and hold steady: elliptic problems.**
Laplace and Poisson equations (steps 9 and 10 of “CFD Python”), explained as systems relaxing under the influence of the boundary conditions and the Laplace operator; introducing the idea of pseudo-time and iterative methods. Linear solvers for PDEs : Jacobi’s method, slow convergence of low-frequency modes (matrix analysis of Jacobi), Jacobi as a smoother, Multigrid.
6. **Tsunami: Shallow-water equation with finite volume method.**
1D first … 2D problem with HPC solution (Python parallel or CUDA Python) -- See [Issue #5](https://github.com/barbagroup/numerical-mooc/issues/5).
