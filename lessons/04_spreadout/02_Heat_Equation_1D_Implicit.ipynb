First of all, you can optimize the memory usage. Check out SciPy's [sparse-matrix storage formats](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/sparse.html): you don't need too store $(N-2)^2$ elements! For example, a `coo_matrix` format stores only $3*N_\\text{nonzero}$, where $N_\\text{nonzero}$ is the number of non-zero elements in `A`. Make sure to explore this topic a little more. It's an important topic in numerical PDEs."
