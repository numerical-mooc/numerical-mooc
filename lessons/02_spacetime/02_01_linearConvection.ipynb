      "Welcome to *Space and Time \u2014 Introduction of Finite-difference solutions of PDEs*, the second module of [\"Practical Numerical Methods with Python!\"](http://openedx.seas.gwu.edu/courses/GW/MAE6286/2014_fall/about). In the first module, we looked into numerical integration methods for the solution of ordinary differential equations, using the phugoid model of glider flight as a motivation. In this module, we will study the numerical solution of *partial differential equations (PDEs)*, where the unknown is a multi-variate function, using the *finite-difference method*. The coming IPython notebooks will cover the linear and non-linear convection equations, the diffusion equation, and Burgers' equation, we hope you will enjoy them!"
