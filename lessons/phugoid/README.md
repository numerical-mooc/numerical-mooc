# Phugoid module outline

1. *Damped pendulum*: nonlinear model derivation; linearization; Euler's method; exact solution;
   convergence; numerical solution of nonlinear model; discretization error and
   modeling error.
2. *Phugoid*: model derivation; discretization with Euler's method; experimentation 
   (with drag).  Second-order Runge-Kutta; order of accuracy; local and global
   error; convergence rate.
3. *Stability*: Experimentation using Euler's method in case of no drag; midpoint method; absolute
   stability.

Theory videos:

A. Local truncation error, consistency, global error, convergence.

B. Stability function, stability, stability+consistency=convergence.
