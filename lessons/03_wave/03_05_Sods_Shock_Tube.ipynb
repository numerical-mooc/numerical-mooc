    "Sod's test problems are standard benchmarks used to assess the accuracy of numerical solvers. The tests use a classic example of one-dimensional compressible flow: the shock-tube problem. Sod (1978) chose initial conditions and numerical discretization parameters for the shock-tube problem and used these to test several schemes, including Lax-Wendroff and MacCormack's. Since then, many others have followed Sod's example and used the same tests on new numerical methods.\n",

We'll lay out the problem for you, but leave important bits of code for you to write on your own. Good luck!"
