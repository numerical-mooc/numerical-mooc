      "In the first notebook, _\"Phugoid Motion\"_, we described the physics of an aircraft's oscillatory trajectory, seen as an exchange of kinetic and potential energy. This analysis goes back to Frederick Lanchester, who published his book _\"Aerodonetics\"_ on aircraft stability in 1909. We concluded that first exposure to our problem of interest by plotting the flight paths predicted by Lanchester's analysis, known as _phugoids_.\n",

It will then enter into a gentle oscillation around the previous straight-line path: a _phugoid oscillation_.\n",
