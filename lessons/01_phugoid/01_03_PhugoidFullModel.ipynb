We gave you a neat little code to play with and plot various phugoid curves.\n",

This is a second-order ordinary differential equation, and we solved it numerically using **Euler's method**: the simplest numerical method of all. We learned about convergence and calculated the error of the numerical solution, comparing with an analytical solution. That is a good foundation!\n",

      "Let's study the convergence of Euler's method for the phugoid model. In the previous lesson, when we studied the straight-line phugoid under a small perturbation, we looked at convergence by comparing the numerical solution with the exact solution. Unfortunately, most problems don't have an exact solution (that's why we compute in the first place!). But here's a neat thing: we can use numerical solutions computed on different grids to study the convergence of the method, even without an analytical solution.\n",

For each element `dt_values[i]`, we will compute the solution `u_values[i]` of the glider model using Euler's method. If we want to use five different values of $\\Delta t$, we'll have five solutions: we put them in an array ... but each one is also an array! We'll have an array of arrays. How meta is that?\n",

To get all the numerical solutions\u2014each with its value of $\\Delta t$\u2014done in one fell swoop, we will loop over the elements of the array `dt_values`. Within the loop, we need to access both `dt_values[i]` and the index `i`. It turns out, `enumerate()` is a built-in Python function that will give us consecutive `index, value` pairs just like we need. \n",
