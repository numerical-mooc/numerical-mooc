In the first notebook, we described the physics of the trajectories known as phugoids obtained from an exchange of potential and kinetic energy in an idealized motion with no drag. We gave you a neat little code to play with and plot various phugoid curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second notebook, we looked at the equation representing small perturbations on the straight-line phugoid, resulting in simple harmonic motion. This is a second-order ordinary differential equation, and we solved it numerically using **Euler's method**: the simplest numerical method of all. We learned about convergence and calculated the error of the numerical solution, comparing with an analytical solution. That is a good foundation!\n",

    "Now, let's go back to the dynamical model, and take away the idealization of no-drag. Let's remind ourselves of the forces affecting an aircraft, considering now that it may be accelerating, with an instantaneous upward trajectory. We use the designation $\\theta$ for the angle, and consider it positive upwards."

Drag is never zero in real life, but as engineers design more aerodynam-ically efficient aircraft, they make the phugoid mode more weakly damped. At altitude, this is nothing but a slight bother, but vertical oscillations are unsafe during final approach to land, so this is something to watch out for!\n"

    "Let's study the convergence of Euler's method for the phugoid model. In the previous lesson, when we studied the straight-line phugoid under a small perturbation, we looked at convergence by comparing the numerical solution with the exact solution. Unfortunately, most problems don't have an exact solution (that's why we compute in the first place!). But here's a neat thing: we can use numerical solutions computed on different grids to study the convergence of the method, even without an analytical solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to be careful, though, and make sure that the fine-grid solution is resolving all of the features in the mathematical model. How can we know this? We'll have a look at that in a bit. Let's see how this works first.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need a sequence of numerical solutions of the same problem, each with a different number of time grid points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a NumPy array called `dt_values` that contains the  time-increment of each grid to be solved on. For each element `dt_values[i]`, we will compute the solution `u_values[i]` of the glider model using Euler's method. If we want to use five different values of $\\Delta t$, we'll have five solutions: we put them in an array ... but each one is also an array! We'll have an array of arrays. How meta is that?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have one more trick up our sleeve: `enumerate()`. To get all the numerical solutions—each with its value of $\\Delta t$—done in one fell swoop, we will loop over the elements of the array `dt_values`. Within the loop, we need to access both `dt_values[i]` and the index `i`. It turns out, `enumerate()` is a built-in Python function that will give us consecutive `index, value` pairs just like we need. \n",
    "\n",
    "Read the code below carefully, and remember: you can get a help pane on any function by entering a question mark followed by the function name. For example, add a new code cell below and type:  `?numpy.empty_like`."

    "In [Lesson 2](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/numerical-mooc/numerical-mooc/blob/master/lessons/01_phugoid/01_02_Phugoid_Oscillation.ipynb), we compared our numerical result to an analytical solution, but now we will instead compare numerical results from different grids. \n",
    "\n",
    "For each solution, we'll compute the difference relative to the finest grid. You will be tempted to call this an _\"error\"_, but be careful: the solution at the finest grid is _not the exact_ solution, it is just a reference value that we can use to estimate grid convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the difference between one solution `u_current` and the solution at the finest grid, `u_finest`, we'll use the $L_1$-norm, but any norm will do.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a small problem with this, though.  The coarsest grid, where $\\Delta t = 0.1$, has 1001 grid points, while the finest grid, with $\\Delta t = 0.001$ has 100001 grid points.  How do we know which grid points correspond to the same location in two numerical solutions, in order to compare them?  \n",
    "\n",
    "If we had time grids of 10 and 100 steps, respectively, this would be relatively simple to calculate.  Each element in our 10-step grid would span ten elements in our 100-step grid. \n",

    "Calculating the _ratio_ of the two grid sizes will tell us how many elements in our fine-grid will span over one element in our coarser grid.\n",
