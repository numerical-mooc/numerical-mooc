    "* going to step away from time issues and start working on pure space analyses.\n",
    "* classic example: poisson's equation - $\\nabla^{2} u = f$\n",
    "* use relaxation methods - take a guess at the solution and then run iteratively until you reach the solution - i would imagine you need some tolerance?\n",
    "    * going to start with the homogenous case of the poisson equation, laplace's equation $\\nabla^{2}=0$\n",
    "* use p to denote that this is using potential theory: $$\\frac{\\partial^{2}p}{\\partial x^{2}}+\\frac{\\partial^{2}p}{\\partial y^{2}}=0$$\n",

    "* Before we solve out the laplace equation, let's take a look at the math of the poisson equation, with no assumptions. Doing this gives us a fuller picture of the discretization scheme and what assumptions make valid sense and how they impact the full discretized solutions.\n",
    "    * in order to solve out the poisson equation, we will use $p(x,y)$ to solve out $\\nabla^{2} p(x,y) = f(x,y)$, with the only assumption made is that both $p(x,y)$ and $f(x,y)$ exist in the shared domain $\\Omega$.\n",
    "    * therefore, the problem we are solving for first, before any assumptions are made, is: $\\frac{\\partial^{2}p}{\\partial x^{2}}+\\frac{\\partial^{2}p}{\\partial y^{2}}=f(x,y)$\n",
